# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

## Project Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where the goal of each user is to mark their turn as an X or an O on a gameboard with three columns and three rows. The first user to get three in a row, either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically will be the winner. If no one wins by the time the board is filled up then the game is a tie.
